# Ryan Cameron Project 1
This program pulls data from https://api.data.gov/ed/collegescorecard, and filters the results based on assigned fields.
The results are added to a database named 'collegescorecard.sqlite'.
This program will also extract data from an excel file, and store the data in the same database in a seperate table.
