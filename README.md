# Ryan Cameron Project 1
This program pulls data from https://api.data.gov/ed/collegescorecard, and filters the results based on assigned fields.
The results are added to a database named 'collegescorecard.sqlite'.
This program will also extract data from an excel file, and store the data in the same database in a seperate table.
This program will open a GUI, which allows the user to choose between updating the data in the database, or visualize the data currently in the database.
The user can further select to display the data in a color coded list in ascending or descending order, or display data in a map.
The list view will compare a states number of jobs and its number of college graduates.
The map view will compare the 3 year graduate cohort declining balance percentage to the 25% salary in the state.
In order to run this program just run main.py.
