# This program pulls data from "https://api.data.gov/ed/collegescorecard", and filters the results based on assigned fields.
# This program does not write to a .txt file, and only prints the results in the terminal.
# The results are added to a database named 'collegescorecard.sqlite.
# The database has only one table name 'schools' and contains data based on the assigned fields('school.state', 'school.city', etc.)
# As of right now I could not get the second test to work properly. I am getting the following error:
#           TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str
